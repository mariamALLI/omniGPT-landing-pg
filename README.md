- Also made use of Grid and Flexbox for full responsiveness.
- Owl carousel for the feedback section

### Built with

### What I learned

Learnt and understood how to use and apply Grid layout from Scrimba learning platform.


### Continued development
- Continous improvement on media query because it was a lit bit challenging
- Currently learning next level JS
